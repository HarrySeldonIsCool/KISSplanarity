A simple planarity algorithm implementation in Julia, based on the article [Tr√©maux trees and planarity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195669811001600?via%3Dihub#br000060) by Hubert de Fraysseix and Patrice Ossona de Mendez. The main change is replacing the edge-specific data structures DS by a global graph of colorability, tested only once at the end of the algorithm. This was done mainly for simplicity's sake, because it actually has a negative effect on performance, possibly even requiring $O(n^2)$ time to validate the edge colorability.
